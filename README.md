Hello, welcome to my 2D game project.

This is a endless runner style game involving a Penguin!

for changes to the game versions please refer to changelog.txt

Builds are in builds Folder

As of 11:49pm on 11/20/2016, apk works, webgl works. exe isn't showing up on rejika. i'll fix it asap. 

Update: 12:49am, exactly one hour later. after multiple connection failures, i was able to push the exe through command line.

everything should be fine now.

Instructions: click to jump, hold to jump longer. click in air to double jump. 

endless mode: just play for a high score and survive.

maze: complete the maze by getting to the flag.

known bugs: game does not register first jump on some android devices. 

clicking on pause acts as a jump

there is technically a way to cheat the high score but not worth fixing.
